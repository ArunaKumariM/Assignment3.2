```{r}
# 2. Create an m x n matrix with replicate(m, rnorm(n)) with m=10
#column vectors of n=10 elements each, constructed with rnorm(n),
#which creates random normal numbers.

#Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables)
#and perform an algebraic operation on each
#element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element
#referred by the two indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal
#function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of
#creating the solution and report the system time differences.


set.seed(2)
#create matrix
matrix_1<- replicate(10,rnorm(10))
matrix_1
#transform into data frame
df_1= data.frame(matrix_1)
# using Sin function 
df_1<- df_1 + 20*sin(pi/2)
df_1

#non-vectorized form
set.seed(2)
#create matrix
matrix_2<- replicate(10,rnorm(10))
#transform into data frame
df_2= data.frame(matrix_2)
for(i in 1:10){
  for(j in 1:10){
    df_2[i,j]<- df_1[i,j] + 20*sin(pi/2)
   # print(df_2)
  }
}
print(df_2)
#time difference
system.time(df_1[i,j]<- df_1[i,j] + 20*sin(pi/2))
system.time(for(i in 1:10)
              {
                for(j in 1:10)
                  {
                    df_2[i,j]<- df_2[i,j] + 20*sin(pi/2)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
